# Intellij_plugins

This repo contains my experiments with Intellij Idea Plugins, written in Java. <br>
First commit helps to enter a custom comment using an option on Tool Menu and EditPopup Menu in another instance.


How to run?
1. Clone the files in the Intellij Idea IDE, and on the right hand side of the screen below x(close), there is an icon of gradle along with notification.
2. Click on Gradle and search for runIde, and then double click to see a new instance of IDE opened, where we open a test project.
3. Activate our plugin through rightclick on the editor or tool menu and click on "Gems" (name has been given in the plugin.xml file).
